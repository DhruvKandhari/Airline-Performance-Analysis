# ✈️ Airline Performance Analysis – Predictive Insights into Flight Delays

### 👋 About This Project
In this analytical project, my team and I explored large-scale airline performance data to uncover factors contributing to flight delays and cancellations. By analyzing millions of flight records, we developed predictive models to accurately forecast airline delays, ultimately aiming to enhance passenger satisfaction and improve airline efficiency.

### 🎯 What I Aimed to Achieve
- Identify key factors that influence airline delays and cancellations.
- Develop robust predictive models to forecast on-time airline performance.
- Provide actionable insights to optimize airline operations and customer experience.

### 🛠️ How I Did It (Skills & Tools Used)
- **Data Analysis & Processing** *(Python, Pandas, NumPy, SQL)*
- **Machine Learning & Predictive Modeling** *(Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors, Scikit-learn)*
- **Data Visualization & Insights Communication** *(Tableau, Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn)*
- **Big Data Management & Optimization** *(Efficiently processed ~11 million data rows)*

### 📈 What I Found
- Airlines such as JetBlue faced the highest arrival and departure delays, whereas Hawaiian Airlines consistently showed the fewest delays.
- Clear seasonal and weekly patterns in delays were identified, highlighting areas for operational improvement.
- Delays varied significantly by aircraft type and airport location, suggesting targeted operational strategies could reduce delays.
- Carrier-specific internal delays represented a significant portion of total delays, highlighting opportunities for internal process improvements.

### 🤖 Predictive Modeling & Results
- Developed and tested multiple machine learning models to forecast delays:

| **Model**             | **Accuracy** | **Computational Time** |
|-----------------------|--------------|------------------------|
| Decision Tree         | 90.14%       | ~50 seconds            |
| Random Forest         | 93.36%       | ~23 minutes            |
| Gradient Boosting     | 93.05%       | ~15 minutes            |
| **K-Nearest Neighbors** *(Best Model)* | **93.53%**   | ~2 minutes |

- The K-Nearest Neighbors model offered the highest accuracy and computational efficiency.

### 🌟 Recommendations Delivered
- Implement predictive analytics into airline operational decision-making processes.
- Focus operational improvements specifically on carriers with frequent internal delays, particularly JetBlue and Frontier.
- Adjust scheduling and operational strategies during identified peak delay periods and seasons.

### 🙋‍♂️ My Role in This Project
- Conducted detailed exploratory data analysis on a vast dataset (~11M rows).
- Built and optimized predictive machine learning models, ensuring high accuracy and efficient performance.
- Designed clear, insightful visualizations and communicated key findings effectively to stakeholders.
