# ✈️ Airline Performance Analysis – Predictive Insights into Flight Delays

### 👋 About This Project
In this analytical project, my team and I explored large-scale airline performance data to uncover factors contributing to flight delays and cancellations. By analyzing millions of flight records, we developed predictive models to accurately forecast airline delays, ultimately aiming to enhance passenger satisfaction and improve airline efficiency.

### 🎯 What I Aimed to Achieve
- Identify key factors influencing airline delays and cancellations.
- Develop robust predictive models to forecast on-time airline performance.
- Provide actionable insights to optimize airline operations and enhance customer experience.

### 🛠️ How I Did It (Skills & Tools Used)
- **Data Analysis & Processing:** *(Python, Pandas, NumPy, SQL)*
- **Machine Learning & Predictive Modeling:** *(Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors, Scikit-learn)*
- **Data Visualization & Reporting:** *(Tableau, Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn)*
- **Big Data Management:** *(Efficiently processed ~11 million rows of data)*

### 📈 What I Found
- Airlines such as JetBlue had the highest arrival and departure delays, while Hawaiian Airlines had the least.
- Significant seasonal and weekly patterns in delays indicated clear opportunities for operational improvements.
- Aircraft type and airport-specific analyses revealed targeted strategies to reduce delays.
- Carrier-specific delays were major contributors, pointing to substantial internal operational opportunities.

### 🤖 Predictive Modeling & Results
Developed and benchmarked several machine learning models:

| **Model**                         | **Accuracy** | **Computational Time** |
|-----------------------------------|--------------|------------------------|
| Decision Tree                     | 90.14%       | ~50 seconds            |
| Random Forest                     | 93.36%       | ~23 minutes            |
| Gradient Boosting                 | 93.05%       | ~15 minutes            |
| **K-Nearest Neighbors (Best Model)** | **93.53%**   | ~2 minutes |

- The **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** model achieved the highest accuracy and computational efficiency, making it ideal for practical deployment.

### 🌟 Recommendations Delivered
- Implement predictive models into airline decision-making processes for proactive delay mitigation.
- Focus on carriers like JetBlue and Frontier Airlines to enhance internal operations and reduce delays.
- Adjust operational schedules proactively based on identified delay patterns and peak delay seasons.

## 💼 Real-world Impact at Freya Systems LLC
At Freya Systems LLC, we faced the challenge of processing **93GB of unstructured airline data** from multiple sources. This complexity significantly slowed down decision-making.

### 🚀 My Solution:
- **Engineered a Python-based data pipeline** with advanced filtering and feature engineering, shrinking the dataset to **21GB** and reducing processing time by **48%**.
- Conducted comprehensive **time series analysis**, uncovering critical insights such as:
  - A **29% flight delay rate at Newark Airport (EWR)**, highlighting potential savings of over **$1.1 billion**.
  - **JetBlue** showed a significant **28% delay rate** (**$1.1 billion** impact).
  - Identified **AIRBUS A320 251N** as the most problematic aircraft, with a **43% delay rate**, amounting to potential losses of **$1.6 billion**.
- Implemented a **K-Nearest Neighbors model** predicting delays with a remarkable **93.5% accuracy**, facilitating proactive operational strategies.
- Designed and deployed **11+ interactive Tableau dashboards**, enabling stakeholders to visualize insights clearly and make informed, strategic decisions for operational improvement.
